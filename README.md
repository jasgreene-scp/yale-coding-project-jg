AI Utilized: Microsoft Copilot
Since I have never used DuckDB or built a cohort before, I used AI to give me some direction as to how to do it.
First, I gave the prompt "How can I use DuckDB to implement cohort construction using OMOP tables?"
Then, I gave the prompt "I would like to pull data from aws S3 buckets to utilize in cohort creation using DuckDB"
